# CSRF & Security

right guys, we are done with this. React to Oriel with everything you've learned.
There's pretty much no front end. You can't go and build now and I want to hear about
all the crazy things that you're building and react now. Yes, there is more that we
can cover. We could talk about react router, which is really useful for single page
apps. We could talk about redux and the flux pattern, which is a more complex but
cleaner way to handle the state. It's also something that avoids the prompts passed
on. Problem we're having currently were some components simply exists just to pass
down to other components

and we can talk about things like higher order components or context or even suicide
rendering. If you want to hear more about those topics or something else, let us know
and we will cover them in a future detour.
